 Date Input Guide
When adding a task, enter the due date in either format:

dd/mm/yyyy â†’ e.g. 25/12/2025

dd/mm/yy â†’ e.g. 25/12/25

 The date must be later than today.
 You get 3 attempts, after which the input process restarts.

 How Archiving Works
Every time you choose Archive Old Tasks, the system will:

 Find tasks older than 30 days
 Check if they're not marked as Done
 Move them to archive.json
 Clean them from your active task list (tasks.json)


ðŸ§ª Testing Archive Feature
To test archiving manually:

Edit a taskâ€™s "created_at" field in tasks.json to be over 30 days ago

Make sure its "status" is not "Done"

Run the program and choose Option 6 (Archive Old Tasks)

The task should move to archive.json

ðŸ’¾ Data Storage
File	Purpose
tasks.json	Stores your current to-dos
archive.json	Stores archived/expired tasks

Both files are in human-readable JSON format â€” no DB setup required.
